Classify sentiments on reviews and extract entities

# Review Analyzer: Entity Extraction and Sentiment Classification

## Overview
This project implements a solution for analyzing product reviews by extracting entities and classifying sentiments. The primary tasks include **Sentiment Classification** and **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, with the goal of providing actionable insights from customer feedback. The project is hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces** and leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to classify review sentiments and recognize entities like products and parts.

## Features
- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies product reviews into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiments using a TensorFlow-based neural network.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracts product-related entities (e.g., "tablet", "screen", "battery") using spaCy‚Äôs custom matcher.
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilizes the Pegasus model for paraphrasing to balance the dataset and improve model generalization.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into review lengths, word distributions, and entity sentiments using graphs and heatmaps.

## Dataset
The project uses the [**Amazon Product Reviews**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products) dataset from Kaggle, specifically focusing on reviews of the **Fire Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB - Includes Special Offers, Black**. Data preprocessing includes:
- Text cleaning (removing stopwords, punctuation).
- Tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
- Labeling review sentiments based on star ratings (1-2 as Negative, 4-5 as Positive, 3 as Neutral).

## Model Design
1. **Sentiment Classification**:
    - TensorFlow-based neural network with L2 regularization and dropout to prevent overfitting.
    - Three experiments were conducted using SMOTE and paraphrasing for data augmentation.
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
    - Uses spaCy matcher to recognize product and part entities with custom rules for extracting common terms like "tablet", "camera", etc.

## Experiments and Results
- **Model 1**: Baseline with no regularization and dropout (using SMOTE for balancing).
- **Model 2**: Added regularization and dropout to improve generalization.
- **Model 3**: Further improvement with data augmentation (paraphrasing).
- Accuracy and performance were measured using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. Visualized results with confusion matrices and accuracy curves.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/review-classify-ner-extractor.git
    cd review-classify-ner-extractor
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Dependencies
- **TensorFlow**: For training the neural network model.
- **spaCy**: For performing named entity recognition.
- **Transformers**: For Pegasus paraphrasing model.
- **Streamlit**: For deploying the web application.
- **scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## Usage

1. Run the app locally or visit the deployed version on Hugging Face Spaces.
2. Enter a product review in the text area and click "Analyze".
3. The app will display:
   - **Extracted Entities**: Key product-related entities.
   - **Sentiment Classification**: Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment of the review.

## Results Visualization
The project includes visualizations for:
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Review lengths and sentiment distributions.
- **Entity Recognition**: Co-occurrence matrix of products and parts.
- **Performance**: Confusion matrices and accuracy curves for model evaluation.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhancing Entity Recognition**: Add more comprehensive rules and machine learning models for better entity recognition.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Incorporate more reviews from different products for improved model generalization.
- **Advanced NLP Models**: Experiment with advanced transformer models like BERT for both sentiment analysis and NER.
